    <p> Enjoy this rich, flavourful beef curry with chapatis or jeera rice. It's a great family dish and ideal for a special occasion, such as Eid</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li> 100ml vegetable oil </li>
            <li> 4 cardamom pods </li>
            <li> 3-4 bay leaves </li>
            <li> 3 cinnamon sticks </li>
            <li> pinch of fenugreek seeds (methi seeds) </li>
            <li> 3 medium onions, sliced </li>
            <li> 1kg braising or stewing beef, cut into bite-sized pieces </li>
            <li> 1½ tsp grated ginger, plus a few thin slices to serve </li>
            <li> 1½ tsp crushed garlic (about 3 cloves) </li>
            <li> 2 tsp hot curry powder (we used hot madras curry powder) </li>
            <li> 1 tsp garam masala </li>
            <li> 1 tsp ground coriander </li>
            <li> 1 tsp ground cumin
            <li> 1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder (optional) </li>
            <li> 1 tsp chilli powder </li>
            <li> 1 tsp turmeric </li>
            <li> 2 tomatoes, quartered </li>
            <li> fresh coriander leaves, to serve </li>
        </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Gently heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the cardamom, bay, cinnamon sticks and fenugreek, and fry for a few minutes until the aromas are released. Add the onions and brown over a high heat for 10-15 mins, stirring occasionally. </li>
            <li> Add the beef, along with the ginger and garlic. Fry until the meat is browned on all sides, about 10 mins. Stir in 1½ tsp salt, followed by the rest of the spices. Mix well and add the tomatoes. Cover and cook over a low-medium heat for about 5 mins, or until the tomatoes are soft. </li>
            <li> Mix the bhuna, cover again and simmer over a low heat for a further 1-1½ hrs, until the beef is tender. (The timing depends on the size of the beef pieces.) If the curry begins to look a little dry while cooking, top up with water.</li>
            <li> Pour in a little water to loosen the curry – how much is up to you, the more you add, the thinner the sauce will be. Boil for 7-10 mins, then scatter over the coriander and sliced ginger, and serve immediately.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
