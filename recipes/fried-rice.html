    <img src="./fried-rice.jpg" alt="fried rice">
    <p> A Fried rice is the ultimate leftover food. We know everyone has a soft spot in their heart for their favorite type of fried rice (we see you, shrimp fried rice-heads), so this recipe is as classic as you can get, perfect for personalizing however you like. Not only is it totally customizable with whatever additional protein and veggies you have in the fridge, but it’s crazy simple to make too.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li> 1 1/2 c. long-grain rice (preferably jasmine), or about 2 1/2 c. leftover rice</li>
            <li> 3 tbsp. peanut or vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li> 3 large eggs, beaten to blend</li>
            <li> 5 cloves garlic, grated or finely chopped</li>
            <li> 1 (1") piece ginger, peeled, grated or finely chopped</li>
            <li> 4 scallions, white, pale green, and dark green parts separated, thinly sliced</li>
            <li> 2 tbsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce </li>
            <li> 1 tsp. granulated sugar</li>
            <li> 1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li> 1/2 tsp. white pepper </li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp. MSG </li>
            <li> 1/3 c. frozen peas </li>
            <li> 1 tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces </li>
        </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Fill a large pot about halfway with water and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, thoroughly rinse rice in a strainer until water runs almost clear. </li>
            <li> Cook rice in boiling water 3 minutes, then drain with a fine-mesh strainer that fits in pot. Wipe out pot, pour in about 2" water, and bring to a simmer. With rice in strainer, make a few divots in rice through to bottom of strainer with a chopstick or butter knife. </li>
            <li> Cover strainer with foil, then place in pot over simmering water. Place pot lid over strainer; if there’s a lot of steam escaping, wrap foil or a damp tea towel around rim of pot and strainer. (This can also be done in a bamboo steamer or a standard steaming setup that won’t let the rice fall through.) </li>
            <li> Steam until rice is cooked through but still slightly al dente, about 15 minutes; it should have a drier feel than normal steamed rice. Spread onto a baking sheet and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until ready to use. </li>
            <li> Heat a large wok or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over high heat. Pour in 1 tablespoon oil and swirl wok to coat. Once oil is shimmering, add eggs and cook, breaking up into small pieces, until cooked through but not browning, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate. Wipe out wok. </li>
            <li> In same wok over high heat, swirl remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Cook garlic and ginger, tossing constantly, until fragrant and garlic begins to brown, about 30 seconds. Add white and pale green scallion parts and cook, tossing constantly, until softened, about 1 minute. Add rice and immediately toss to combine. Fry rice, stirring constantly, until no clumps remain and you begin to hear some light popping sounds from the rice toasting, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
            <li> Add soy sauce, granulated sugar, salt, pepper, and MSG and cook, tossing constantly, until soy sauce is absorbed, about 1 minute. Add eggs, peas, and dark green scallion parts and cook, tossing constantly, until warmed through and incorporated, about 2 minutes more. Add butter and cook, tossing, until melted, about 30 seconds more. </li>
            <li> Serve and enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
