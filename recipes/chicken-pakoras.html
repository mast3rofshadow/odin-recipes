    <p> Enjoy this rich, flavourful beef curry with chapatis or jeera rice. It's a great family dish and ideal for a special occasion, such as Eid</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li> 700g boneless chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li> 2 tbsp cornflour</li>
            <li> 50g rice flour</li>
            <li> 40g gram flour, sieved</li>
            <li> 3 dried chillies, crushed or 3 green chillies, finely chopped</li>
            <li> ½ tsp chilli powder</li>
            <li> ½ tsp curry powder</li>
            <li> ½ tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li> ½ tsp cumin</li>
            <li> 2 small onions, chopped</li>
            <li> small bunch of coriander, finely chopped</li>
            <li> vegetable oil, for deep-frying</li>
            <li> sweet chilli sauce or green chutney, to serve</li>
        </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Put the chicken in a large bowl, then use your hands to coat the pieces in the cornflour. Mix in the rice flour, followed by the gram flour. Add the chillies, spices, onion, coriander and 1 tsp salt. Mix well with your hands. </li>
            <li> Gradually add around 150ml water until the ingredients have become moist and ever-so-slightly wet. You may not need all the water (adding too much will stop the pakora mixture binding). </li>
            <li> Fill a deep pan no more than a third full with vegetable oil and heat to 180C. Squeeze a small amount of the pakora mixture together before carefully lowering into the hot oil with a spoon. Fry for 8-10 mins, turning regularly, until cooked through and browned all over. Set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper while you repeat with the remaining mixture, frying in small batches. Serve hot with a sweet chilli sauce or green chutney. </li>
            <li> Serve and Enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
