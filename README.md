My first test project in The Odin Project

This is my first test project in the Odin Project. Here I have to make a recipe page using html for The Odin Project. In this page I have to provide 3 or more food/dish recipes using texts, images, paragraphs, lists etc. I have to make sure each recipe has their own individual html page. And then I have to link all of those recipe page into the main index page. Hope I can do it without any hassle, wish me luck please. Thank you and have a nice day everyone!
